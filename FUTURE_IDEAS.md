# Future Ideas for lullabot-project

This document captures potential future enhancements and features for the lullabot-project CLI tool.

## Task System Enhancements

### Task Dependencies

- Allow tasks to depend on other tasks
- Automatic dependency resolution and ordering
- Example: `git-hooks` task depends on `composer-deps` task

### Conditional Tasks

- Tasks that only run under certain conditions
- Environment-based conditions (OS, Node version, etc.)
- Project-based conditions (file exists, specific content, etc.)
- Example: Only install PHP extensions if PHP is detected

### Task Validation

- Validate prerequisites before running tasks
- Check if required tools are installed
- Verify file permissions and access
- Example: Check if `npx` is available before running memory bank setup

### Task Ordering

- Explicit task ordering beyond just array order
- Priority levels for tasks
- Parallel task execution where possible

## IDE and Project Support

### Additional IDEs

- **VS Code**: Extensions, settings, launch configurations
- **PhpStorm**: Project settings, code style configurations
- **Sublime Text**: Package installations, project settings
- **Vim/Neovim**: Plugin installations, configuration files

### Additional Project Types

- **React**: ESLint config, Prettier setup, testing framework
- **Laravel**: Artisan commands, environment setup, testing
- **WordPress**: Plugin development setup, coding standards
- **Node.js**: Package.json scripts, testing setup
- **Python**: Virtual environment, linting tools, testing
